        As someone once said - The first lesson of any new venture -
        "Disappointment". Fear of failure is something that is natural to human
        beings and it has its evolutionary basis. Humans are the only species
        that can remember their past and plan for the future. Planning for the
        future and sometimes being scared for the future helped our ancestors to
        move on to the top of the food chain. Our mind is constantly trying to
        figure out where we stand in the present and to do that it gathers
        information and memories from the past both good and bad and projects a
        future based on the past data. It is normal for humans to be scared
        about the future and also to remember our past so that we can learn from
        our mistakes and not repeat them in the future. The by-product of this
        process may sometimes result in anxiety and panic which is completely
        normal. Our Mind wants to do easy and predictable things, it wants
        security and not growth and growth never happens in the comfort zone. We
        first have to make ourselves come out of our comfort zone and our mind
        will soon follow the trail. As one would say "Well begun is half done‚Äù.
