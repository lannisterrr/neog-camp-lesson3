        Here I was in 11th standard, when I first got to know about this thing
        called programming, before that, I thought there were some computer gods
        running this machine. I had zero clues about how computers work and what
        can we do with it, other than play video games and type stuff. And soon
        after, when I started to go through my computer book there was this
        thing called "JAVA". This was the hardest thing for me to understand
        (apart from maths). But my teacher at that time pushed me to learn
        programming and it turned to be a great thing for me .
      </p>

      <h2>Great Things take time!</h2>
      <p>
        As I was learning programming I happened to come across a chapter in my
        academic book called 'Web Technologies'. This was about how can we make
        web pages. I started to take interest in this subject because I always
        wanted to write a tech blog. But more I read about this, I came to know
        that there is a lot to learn and I can't learn all this because of the
        heavy academic workload. But still, I decided to give it a shot and
        started learning the basics like HTML and CSS from a youtube channel
        called "Envato tuts+'. It was a 30-day course and each day I learnt a
        new thing about web development. After 30 days I thought that I am ready
        to build a blog and put it on the internet. But as it turns out you need
        a lot more skills to do that. But thanks to youtube, I discovered
        'WordPress- where you don't need technical skills to write a blog.
      </p>

      <h2>Web Development is simple but not easy</h2>
      <p>
        I started writing blogs about technology related news. It was called
        'sidzone'(My name was already taken) and on the side, I was learning
        backend languages like PHP(RIP!). To make sure people read my blogs I
        used to share the links in various forums and WhatsApp groups. One day
        when I came from my school and I opened my email and there was this
        company based in Chennai who wanted me to build websites for their two
        clients. One was a school website and other one was a law firm .
        Remember, I didn't apply for the job, They approached me through my
        blogs, which was kind of shocking at that time. They asked me which tech
        stack I wanted to use and I suggested 'WordPress to them, as this was
        the only thing I knew at that time to build a full-fledged website. They
        agreed and I made them the two websites and first time earned any money
        in my life.
